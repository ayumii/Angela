			"title": "CHANNELS AND PRICING STRATEGY",
			"description": "This is a course that is meant for two important marketing mix variables, channel management and pricing. In Channel Management, not much attention is usually paid to understanding marketing channels in detail. In fact people used to call channels the `dark continent? of marketing, that is best left to `truckers?. But, is this true? One can make at least four observations: long term commitment of channel related decisions, existence of channel `power play,? market dynamics caused by channel changes, and the impact of internet on channel intermediaries. All these issues are very difficult to comprehend and solve if we do not understand `what channels are for?? Channel management is not just managing the retailers and the trucks and delivery personnel, but it is much larger than that. In Pricing, the one element of marketing strategy that is least understood and hence constantly feared by many managers is pricing. This is because pricing is a very complex issue. On one hand, it is supposed to reflect all the strategic steps the company has taken to bring the product to the consumer and convince him/her to buy it as well. On the other hand, it is supposed to reflect what the consumer would get out of the product by paying that price to acquire it. Will there be a match between the two? Perhaps and perhaps not. This dilemma makes it imperative for a manager needs to understand and analyze various factors in arriving at an appropriate pricing strategy. And, pricing does not operate in vacuum. It has to be married with other elements of the marketing strategy, including the channel management we discuss in this course. Thus, understanding the broader picture of the various elements of pricing, and building a scientific framework on pricing will always be reliable and better in the long run.",

We take our students through market equilibrium, competition, monopoly, price and non-price business strategies. Our teaching methodology takes a fundamentally problem-solving approach. Models and analytical skills are introduced in order to solve business problems systematically.Information technology and the Internet have made many changes in the way businesses are run, and Managerial Economics has changed significantly with it. We now devote a new portion of this course to discussing how network effects propel the information age, resulting in significant monopoly powers such as Microsoft. Related anti-trust and other cases are also discussed and analysed.",

Starting with fluid properties and fluid statics, the student would understand how these concepts are used for the calculation of hydrostatic forces and the stability of floating bodies. The student is introduced to the concepts of fluid flow, ideal and real fluids and their limitations, laminar and turbulent flows, the concept of the boundary layer and flow resistance, the concept of flow separation and the wake, frictional and form drag and lift on immersed bodies. Dimensional analysis and the concept of similitude will help reinforce the fundamental considerations essential for experiments with fluid phenomena. By the end of the course, the student should understand the concepts of conservation of mass, momentum and energy and how these can be applied to flow measuring devices, to the estimation of frictional losses for flows in pipelines, to pumping systems and other engineering applications.",

			"description": "In today's construction, there is increasing competition from global players with international participation. Due to this competition, a company, for its own survival, will need to venture into construction markets overseas. This course has been repositioned with a new title and content to give in-depth coverage of issues that affect engineering constructors involved in large-scale infrastructure projects in international construction markets. The course goes beyond the basics covered in the first undergraduate course and emphasises the global characteristics of large-scale civil infrastructure projects. Specific topics include international construction markets and project financing, risk management, value management, competitive bidding, integrated construction logistics, computer-integrated scheduling and resource allocation, construction modeling and simulation. Students benefit from the experience of speakers from large international engineering constructor companies involved in the development of such infrastructure projects. This course equips students to successfully manage complex infrastructure projects in international construction markets. They will learn to manage complex construction logistics and value chain from design to construction. The course will also deal with the problems of financing and managing the risk of such large-scale projects. Students will also learn advanced computerised techniques for project planning, modeling and simulation.",

The teaching objective of the module is for faculty members with expertise in relevant fields of chemical research to impart knowledge on, provide guidance to and stimulate creative thinking of students with interest in modern chemistry. The students are expected to gain in-depth understanding of the chosen topic through discussions/meetings with the faculty members, his/her own research work, and preparation and presentation of written/oral reports. Each student is assigned at least one adviser from the faculty. The student should meet with his/her adviser at the beginning of the semester. The adviser and student will select a topic for investigation within the advisers area of expertise. For example, the assignment might require the students to read some recent journal articles or chapters in selected books. During subsequent meetings, the student and adviser will discuss the material and related issues. The student will then prepare a brief written report summarizing the background and significance of the problem under consideration, the approaches used to solve the problem, and the results of the investigations reported in the articles or books. The written report is due at the end of the semester. The student will also be required to make two oral presentations (one around the middle of the semester, and another one at the end of the semester) to show his or her understanding of the problem, and what he or she has read.",

Starting from simple single stage, binary separation, the theoretical treatment is extended to multi-component, multi-stage processes. After brief introduction to inter-phase mass transfer, basic concepts in rate-based design for the more important separation processes such as absorption and distillation are illustrated. The rate-based design concept is then extended to operations involving simultaneous heat and mass transfer such as in cooling tower and dryer. The process design principles are illustrated with distillation, absorption, extraction, adsorption, cooling tower and drying processes.",

In the process of developing these tools, we will discuss the determinants of consumption and investment. Next we turn to different business cycle theories. Specifically, we study the Keynesian, New Keynesian, Neo Classical and Real Business Cycle models, and examine their different assumptions and policy prescriptions for macroeconomic stabilization. IS-LM and AD-AS frameworks are employed in studying some or all of these paradigms. Finally, we evaluate the predictions of these models against business cycle facts. We will also briefly review national income accounting and discuss some measurement issues.",

The module begins with ways of summarizing economic data, including the use of frequency distributions and measures of central tendency and dispersion. This is followed by an initiation into the concepts of classical probability, paving the way for the important topics of random variables and probability distributions. Next, the core ideas of classical statistical inference are introduced - including sampling distributions, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing and analysis of variance. Finally, correlation and regression analyses will be covered.",

It is designed to equip students with the standard tools and techniques to analyze microeconomic issues and to prepare them to access higher level modules that utilize microeconomic analysis. The module begins with a review of several foundation topics on consumer and producer theory covered in the prerequisite course, i.e. EC2101. It then moves on to discuss the general equilibrium model, whereby consumers and producers are put together in a general equilibrium framework. After that, it covers choice over time, i.e. inter-temporal choice and choices over different states of the world, i.e. choices under uncertainty. It then continues with game theory. This topic will be discussed extensively. Coverage will include various solution concepts for one-shot games and sequential move games. Applications of the theory on the issues of oligopolistic competition, entry and entry prevention, and network economics will receive a great deal of attention. Finally, the module ends with the asymmetric information, i.e. moral hazard and adverse selection and its application on the internal organisation of the firm. Throughout the course, empirical observations and real-life cases pertaining to the issues discussed in this module are presented.",

We next examine the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve, and simple inflation-unemployment dynamics. We also study further policy issues (time inconsistency, Ricardian Equivalence, profit-sharing), open-economy macroeconomics (the Mundell-Fleming model), and simple growth theory (the Solow model and the AK endogenous growth model).",

			"description": "This course builds on basic microeconomic theories and concepts and extends the theory to deal with the idiosyncrasies of the transport sector. For example, the concept of \"price\" is generalized to include the value of time to the traveller. The demand for transporting freight is explained using the theory of the derived demand for an input, but the impact of modern approaches to management (e.g. logistics) is considered. Just as the concept of \"price\" requires modification, \"output\" too has many dimensions. In particular, this course will examine ways in which transport firms derive economies of scale when they operate in a network. It covers concepts of price discrimination, social cost benefit analysis and regulation. The course also uses case studies to provide important insights into the economics and management of different parts of the transport sector.",

			"description": "This course is divided into two main sections, short- and long- run macro-economic analysis. In the first section, we discuss the solution of simple stochastic rational expectations models, and examine the main features of, and the key issues in the controversy between, the new classical, real business cycle, and Keynesian-New- Keynesian schools of thought. Topics covered include the Lucas, Sargent-Wallace and Fischer (overlapping wage contract) models, as well as the Shapiro-Stiglitz efficiency wage model and Romer's menu cost - coordination failure model. In the second section, various inter-temporal optimization models are analysed, and their salient economic lessons discussed. Topics covered include a two-period model, overlapping-generations models with certain and uncertain lifetimes, Hall's life-cycle-permanent-income model, as well as optimal control models of investment behaviour and endogenous growth. A lecture on some principal macroeconomic features of the Singapore Economy concludes the course.",

Three main parts of the course are growth theory, business cycle models, and the investigations of certain components in the aggregate demand. Topics under each part are wide-ranging: the Solow model, the infinite horizon model, overlapping generations model, and endogenous growth models are covered for the growth part. The business cycle models deal with real business cycles, the Lucas model, and New Keynesian models. Finally, consumption, consumption-based asset pricing models and investment are studied for the aggregate demand components.",

It serves to demonstrate to students how the EE curriculum is designed to address these aspects via a top-down approach. The module consists of 5 distinct parts of approximately 6 hour lectures and integrated with some self-learning activities. Each part focuses on each of the following areas / topics: • Communications and Networking • Control and Energy Systems • Micro / nanoelectronics • Multimedia Signal Processing • Grand challenges for engineering – the role of EE The lectures will be conducted by a group of faculty members who are experts in the respective areas. Although the lectures are meant to focus on contemporary issues and emerging technologies, an appropriate level of historical perspective will be used to demonstrate how each subfield has evolved from the traditional areas of EE so that students can see both the connections between different areas and the driving force behind the rapid development and expansion of EE in the last few decades. Prior to this series of lectures focusing on specific areas, a detailed introduction of the EE curriculum will also be given in the first lecture. The philosophy underpinning the curriculum and its strength and constraints will be highlighted. The module will conclude with student presentations on a topic in an area of their interest. Students are assessed through assignments, reports and presentations.",

			"description": "This course provides an intensive introduction to key topics in post-colonial theory through an overview of representative literary and theoretical texts. The syllabus demonstrates the vexed significance of the “post” in post-colonial cultural traditions. In tracing how decolonization remains bound up with older, colonial forms of knowledge/power, we approach post-coloniality as an aftermath. Through a range of writerly forms and cultural media, we identify the post-colonial in the question of “tradition” and its centrality to “non-Western” modernity; in inscriptions of race/ethnicity/sexuality into Third World humanism; as the mourning for a vanishing past; as aesthetic resistance to homogenizing processes of modernization.",

Besides obvious technological effects and the accelerated exchange it enables, how has the new, informational paradigm affected our psychology, everyday life and work; our understandings of place and community, of history and culture? Rather than placing Pynchon within a literary canon, seminars will be thematic studies, drawing on a wide range of critical theory, cultural history, and critiques of globalisation and technology.",

To alternative ways of conceiving life, experience, or reality? To traditional history? To alternative futures? To projections of, and apprehensions about human society? How does the imaginative construction of dystopias, in particular, address the constantly changing relation of science and technology to human life as we know it, to the human individual, to human society, and to the many institutions and notions, from gender and sexuality to race, family, nation, religion and species through which the relation of the individual to the group is mediated in time and place?

			"description": "A vital element in giving an effective public performance is presenting a credible persona. In this course, you will examine concepts such as role and identity, speaker credibility, talk and gestures, and audience perception. You will explore the innateness and invention of specific speech traits and behaviours—with a focus on how a public persona is strengthened or attenuated, and shaped—by analyzing various performances (i.e., interview, roundtable discussion, public talk, and the US presidential debate 2012).

We will look at how images are arrayed with words in news sources to create a truth-effect. Unearthing the norms of objectivity that readers accept, we will ask how particular blogs and feeds become more credible than others. We will examine what happens to the truth-effect when images are digitized and manipulable. Lastly, we will analyze how they form persuasive arguments in documentaries that question the boundary between fact and faction, such as The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.",

Looking at classic and current examples of non-fiction crime and disaster writing, we will explore the craft of writing on sensitive subjects with objectivity and clarity. Crime and disaster stories require detailed anecdotes and descriptions to hold the reader. But they often draw upon official documents that are sometimes bland statements of fact, eyewitness accounts that vary greatly, or the seemingly hidden world of text and social media. We will cast a critical eye over this process of building essays reports or memos with facts and interviews and discuss how some of the best writers in the business get it right, or not.",

Costs associated with legal liability and employee benefit programmes, particularly Central Provident Fund (CPF) and health care, have become matters of deep concern to company management. Individuals seeking coverage of their professional and personal risks have similar concerns. This course analyses the nature and impact of these risks and discusses appropriate risk management techniques. The emphasis is on the analysis and management of these problems for business entities, but these are substantial implications for the problems faced by individual and society.

Important topics covered will include the progress and pitfalls of the human genome project and how advances in biochemistry have informed our understanding of human disease. The course will also cover revolutionary advances in neuroscience, the cardiovascular and metabolic system, and cancer, and how these have shaped our understanding of human disease. The transfer of information gathered in basic science research to the clinic will be examined, along with the impact this has had on society as a whole. Students will learn some of the basic scientific and clinical principles underlying these advances, and will examine how they are placed in a medical, social, legal and ethical context.

			"description": "The development of mathematical concepts and theories is often influenced by an intuition acquired from physical experience and by analogy with various areas of scientific and mathematical knowledge. Analogy is an important factor in preparing, if not predicting, new concepts while an experience-based intuition can sometimes be an obstacle. The objective of this seminar module is to present case studies of the creative role of analogy in mathematics and of the ground-breaking importance of \"counter-intuition\" in modern mathematics. A wealth of examples of both can be found in geometry, number theory, analysis, algebra, logic, set theory and theoretical computer science. Students of this module are expected to source for relevant material in books, journals and the internet under the guidance of the lecturer. The emphasis, however, will be on the spirit of the mathematical enterprise rather than on the technical mastery. To illustrate the use of analogy and intuition in problem solving, some elementary problems and puzzles will be posed in class for attempt and discussion. The main prerequisite for this module is an inquiring mind open to new ideas.

			"description": "Sustainable development and environment protection is the important global theme in 21st century. It is well recognized by the world’s scientific, industrial and political communities that the atmospheric concentration of CO2 has been steadily increasing due to human activities and economic development, which accelerates the greenhouse effect. In 1997, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) mandated a reduction of CO2 emission levels to below those of 1990. To reduce the CO2 emission and maintain a desired balance in atmosphere, new technologies have been developed. CO2 capture and storage is one of the approaches. It is also possible to convert CO2 to some reusable hydrocarbons or chemicals through physical, chemical and biological processes. The most important challenge is how to activate CO2 economically as it has high thermodynamic stability. Solar energy should be one of the best candidates because it is totally clean and abundant. Consequently, the highly efficient and selective photochemical reduction systems for CO2 are highly desired. In addition, alternative energy resources and technologies also play vital roles in the reduction of CO2 emission.",

In this module students will explore the beneficial side of animal toxins. They will find out information about how some of the life-saving drugs were designed and developed based on toxin structure through case studies in groups. They will also participate in discussions on toxinbased drugs for some of devastating diseases such as heart attack, stroke and cancer.

Each lecture will touch on contemporary scenarios and geographical analyses of issues. Students will also be exposed to field work techniques and strategies of project management in group discussions and project assignments. The goal is to develop students with strong ‘geographical imaginations’ better able to understand the world and all its complexities.",

It also allows students to engage with emerging issues that are likely to become focal points in shaping future debates among political geographers. The aim of the module is to explore the co-constitutive relationship between politics and space. As the political organization of society has spatial consequences, so too does geography influence our understanding of political relationships. These relations are negotiated and contested in multiple ways that cut across different locations, scales, and temporalities. Accordingly, we will examine political concerns, disputes, accommodations, and consequences from a geographical perspective, where students can expect to acquire a critical appreciation for the historical trajectories and evolving implications of states, sovereignty, territoriality, nationalism, colonialism, democracy, ethnic conflict, policing and crime, terrorism, war, environmental justice, and political activism.",

It looks at how Southeast Asian societies and political systems have changed over time in response to the pressures of ecology, colonialism, nationalism, urbanization and globalization. The module also looks at the way ethnic, religious, national and regional identities have been constructed, used and altered over time. The overall objective is to provide students with an introduction to different ways of exploring Southeast Asia and different experiences of living in the region.",

Moreover, as a result of the expansion of global urban population, more food needs to be produced, moved to cities and distributed; insufficient food supply and inefficient food distribution systems will result in higher food prices. The global demand for more food results in the globalization of the food supply, increasing the risk of spreading food-borne diseases across international borders. Recent stories about tainted strawberries, infected chickens, mad cow disease, for instance, have increased public concern on the need of a safe food supply. By the end of this course, the students should be able to understand the causes and current character of food insecurity, the essentials of food safety, factors affecting global food supply, and the effects of biotechnology on a secure and safe food supply.",

Every day, we are faced with news that human development and consumption come at a cost to the environment. There are 7 billion people living on Earth today and our demand for resources exerts an extraordinary mount of pressure on the planet and our environment. Globally biodiversity is disappearing through habitat destruction, overfishing and mining. Rivers, lakes and seas are polluted by sewerage and marine debris; soot and smoke pollute the air we breathe. Singapore is geographically located in one of the most biodiversity-rich areas in the world, but Southeast Asia is losing a large quantity of its natural resources due to anthropogenic effects. Through this module, students are introduced to a variety of nterdisciplinary topics related to environmental issues today.",

Examining cultural icons from Japan's past and present we will unpack the assumptions, stereotypes, narrative strategies, and visualizing techniques of representing Japan. Students will probe one or more of Japan's three famous cultural icons - the samurai, the geisha, and/or the yakuza - as they appear in literature, visual and performance arts, and academic writings. By the end of the module students will not only have a richer understanding of the 'realities' behind such icons, but more significantly, they will be equipped to challenge stereotypes of Japan presented by journalism, popular culture, and the humanistic and social sciences. Ultimately such discovery will lead students to question their own knowledge of self and other. Students should refer to the module IVLE page for details of the selected icon(s) for the current semester.",

Alternatively, students may participate in research led by a College Fellow or other academic, as long as the project gives the student exposure to forms of expertise and/or interests that go beyond any particular discipline. The aim of the UROP is to help support a student’s academic and professional development through a meaningful research apprenticeship. The UROP is a graded module.",

However, due to the diverse student population at Tembusu, the prerequisite is that students should have completed at least one Senior Seminar at the College, as well as at least one Ideas and Exposition module or a faculty-based writing course. This ensures that the student has gained familiarity with the ways of working and norms for academic engagement at Tembusu College and has had some training in academic writing. Besides preparing the student, these prerequisites allow the College to make an assessment regarding the student’s suitability for a UROP and potential to benefit from it. Approval for any particular UROP needs to be secured from the College through the Director of Studies.",

But the significance of its impact on the structure of the region's 'contemporary' history is more debatable, for revisionist historians are wont to discount the thesis that the War represented a significant turning point or watershed which 'transformed' the region's history. Drawing on both country and regional perspectives, this module first assesses the impact of the War on the theme of decolonization, perhaps the one major historically significant process to dominate the region's political terrain in the immediate post-war aftermath. It will further examine the challenges and trials confronting the new states &quot;after&quot; decolonization, in particular, their search not only for new political frameworks to replace the colonial structures they had discarded, but also for solutions to mitigate the issues of social integration, inter-state conflict and regional co-operation.",

These are some of the questions we will be engaging with in this course. There are two segments to the course. In the first segment, we will examine general theories of statereligion relations, including liberal assumptions of the dominant theory of the separation of church and state (the “disestablishment theory”), the rise and fall of the secularization thesis, and alternative theories. During the second segment, we will examine statereligion relations through topical issues in selected countries in Southeast Asia, including how legal systems in Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia accommodate Syariah Courts, and how separationist claims based on religious difference and identities are advanced in the Philippines and Thailand.",

Through reflecting upon these and other questions, we will explore if and how thistrialshaped the Western culture.

Six types of energy will be dealt with, concerning (1) the transformation of light energy to chemical energy by plants, (2) the transformation of chemical energy to chemical potential energy of ions and water across bio-membranes, (3) the transformation of chemical potential energy to electrical energy by plasmalemma with special emphasis on neurons, (4) the transformation of chemical energy to mechanical energy by muscle, and (5) the production and release of heat during energy transformation. Since neurons and muscle tissues require a relatively constant extracellular environment for them to function properly, the important concept of homeostasis will be discussed. Emphasis will be on extracellular fluid volume and composition. In addition, mechanisms involved in the balance of heat gain and heat loss to maintain a constant body temperature will be covered.",

Plants are not only the primary source of food, but they are also responsible for maintaining the correct balance of gases in the environment. Many of the life processes occurring in the plant cells are similar to that in animal cells. However, plant cells possess unique and distinctive properties. This course deals with the integration of different physiological phenomena and provides an understanding of different life processes in living plants. The effects of the environment on these different life functions will also be discussed. How such information can be applied to our benefit, for example increased plant productivity and the extension of shelf-life of produce will also be discussed.",

First of all, it helps to crystallize fundamental concepts and elucidate the roles they play in the theory. Secondly, it provides a unified framework for applications of the results and techniques of mathematical analysis. This module will cover the basic theory of metric spaces and sample applications to other areas of mathematics. It is highly recommended to students majoring in pure mathematics and to those who are interested in applied mathematics with an analytical flavour. Major topics: Euclidean spaces, inner product and Euclidean norm. Metric spaces: definition, examples. Topological concepts: open sets and closed sets, subspaces, density and separability. Convergence of sequences, completeness, nowhere dense sets, Baires category theorem and applications. Continuity of functions and uniform continuity. Compactness: open covers, Heine-Borel Theorem, extreme value theorem. Equivalences of compactness, sequential compactness, and completeness and total boundeness. Connectedness, characterizations of subintervals of the real line, intermediate value theorem, path-connectedness. Contraction mappings, Banachs fixed point theorem and applications. Function spaces: pointwise and uniform convergence for sequences and series of functions, Weierstrass M-test, boundedness and equicontinuity, Arzela-Ascoli Theorem.

			"description": "This is an introductory course to fluid mechanics as applied to engineering. After introducing the basic terminology and a classification of fluid and flow, the students are taught fluid statics, which cover hydrostatic forces on submerged bodies, surface tension forces, buoyancy, metacentric height and stability of floating bodies. Numerous examples of engineering application pertaining to each aspect of fluid statics are presented. In the section on fluid dynamics, basic principles of fluid motion are introduced. This covers the continuity equation, Bernoulli and energy equations, and free-surface flows including hydraulic jumps. The momentum equation and its engineering application using the control volume approach are included. The section on flow measurements introduces students to a variety of common instrumentation that are used in pressure, velocity and volumetric measurements, and this is reinforced with laboratory experiments. In the analysis of engineering results, the dimensional analysis and similitude are taught, with engineering examples. This is a core module.",

In today's information-oriented environment, a marketing manager cannot succeed without a thorough understanding of the research process. By understanding the research process, he can better judge the suitability, reliability and the validity of a research study in his decision-makings. Students will learn by doing in this course. While we will use class time to discuss appropriate research topics, students are required to do lots of activities by themselves in order to facilitate their learning by doing. In doing so, this course incorporates an experimental element in marketing research and consulting. As a marketing information provider, students will be assisting a firm by collecting and interpreting market data as a means toward the development of a superior marketing plan. At the same time, students will conduct tutorial activities that will provide opportunities for students to practice the key topics covered in the class. This course is intended to acquaint students with the fundamental marketing research process. More specifically, this course aims: (i) To familiarise the student with the fundamental marketing research skills of problem formulation, research design, questionnaire design, data collection, data analysis, and report presentation and writing. (ii) To have the student gain perspective and practice in applying these skills through a research project. (iii) To develop an understanding of decision making in marketing, its inherent difficulties and pitfalls and the importance of information in marketing research.",

			"description": "The digital age has fundamentally altered the manner we collect, process, analyse and disseminate market intelligence. Driven by advances in hardware, software and communications, the very nature of market research is rapidly changing. New techniques are emerging. The increased velocity of information flow enables marketers to respond with much greater speed to changes in the marketplace. Market research is timelier, less expensive, more actionable and more precise ... all of which makes it of far greater importance to marketers. Applied Market Research is primarily designed for marketing professionals to train them to use market knowledge for day-to-day marketing decisions. It will provide good understanding of many prevalent research techniques and their application. The course will be taught in an application-oriented fashion through lectures, class discussions and case studies. Students will acquire critical analysis and decision making abilities to prepare them to tackle the marketing and business issues they are likely to confront in a career in marketing.",

The field of organisational behaviour covers a wide range of topics: organisational culture, motivation, decision making, communication, work stress and so on.

(2) how can we use this information to improve the effectiveness of the organisation?",

Throughout the course an attempt will be made to understand the way students think, the biases they hold when making decisions and interpreting environmental stimuli in the context of organisations, and the ways in which their emotions influence their decisions and judgments. Also highlighted will be the usefulness of introspection and an awareness of their own thought processes and assumptions... an aim that almost all religions and many academic pursuits attempt forward, yet one which is often excluded from the study of business to the detriment of business people.",

Also considered are: relationships between chamber music and its socio-political and cultural contexts; the changing social function of chamber music and musicians; various performance contexts; trends in musical aesthetics; and the evolution of chamber music’s languages and styles. Students undertake a significant research project into a chamber work for their instrument, and lead discussions and perform in research seminars on that work. Students acquire the skills, knowledge, and confidence necessary to the critical appraisal of, and independent research into the repertoire they play.",

It is designed for non-physics students, and proceeds mainly by analogy and contrast with the familiar. Concepts will be emphasised, while omitting the technical details.",

Topics covered include a) Electricity and magnetism, where the basic concepts of electric and magnetic fields, forces on charged particles, electric potential, electromotive force, work and energy, are described. The properties of basic electrical circuits comprising resistors, inductors and capacitors are discussed, along with analysis of their transient and steady-state behaviour. Understanding the role of Maxwell's equations in electromagnetism is emphasized; b) Waves, introducing properties of waves, including geometric optics, propagation, interference and diffraction, and electromagnetic waves; and c) Quantum physics, where new physics concepts which led to the quantization of energy are introduced, leading to an explanation of atomic transitions, atomic spectra and the physical and the chemical properties of the atom. The uncertainty principle, wave-mechanics and wave particle duality concepts are covered, together with the use of wavefunctions in predicting the behaviour of trapped particles. The module is targeted essentially at Engineering students.",

The introduction consists of a revision of the laws of electric and magnetic fields in vacuo and multipole expansion. The properties of fields in dielectric and magnetic materials are discussed in some detail. Following a review of magnetic induction, the formulation of Maxwell's equations is presented. Some important implications are discussed, together with applications of Maxwell's equations to boundary value problems and waveguides. Electromagnetic waves and retarded potentials are introduced, and illustrated with dipolar radiating systems. The course stops short of the relativistic treatment of electrodynamics.",

After a discussion of the various versions of Bernoulli's equation and the concept of vorticity, the study of fluid flows starts with the potential flows, with an application to the theory of airfoils. The theory of irrotational water waves is then presented to illustrate dispersive wave propagation and the hyperbolic tendency to form shocks. The balance of these two tendencies produces soliton solutions. The concept of flow similarity is applied to the study of boundary layer. The phenomenon of boundary layer separation is discussed. The concept of hydrodynamic instability is illustrated with the Rayleigh-Benard convection problem. The chaotic dynamics of the related Lorenz equation is then presented. A brief introduction to turbulence closes the module.",

The core of the module is the canonical quantization of the electromagnetic field and the introduction of the corresponding vector space (“Fock space”) and field operators. Then, we present the main families of states (number, thermal, coherent, squeezed) and the most typical measurement techniques (photo-detection, homodyne measurement, first- and second-order coherence, Hong-Ou-\\Mandel bunching). The statistical nature of light fields is highlighted. Finally, we present the basic case studies of photon-atom interactions in the full quantum approach: cavity quantum electrodynamics (Janyes-Cummings model), spontaneous decay (Wigner-Weisskopf approach).",

Our starting point is a conception of ourselves as free and conscious beings equipped with bodies that allow us to observe and explore a familiar external world. Successive lectures investigate alternative conceptions of the human condition, such as ones in which we are unfree, or non-spirituous, or inhabit a world whose fundamental nature is hidden from our view. Different conceptions bear differently on the further question of what we should value and why. Discussion is both argument-driven and historically informed.",

Students will learn what an argument is, what the difference between validity and soundness is, and what it means to say that an argument is valid in virtue of its form. They will also be introduced to various strategies and pitfalls in reasoning. In addition, to hone their analytical skills, students will be given arguments—drawn from philosophy and other areas—to unpack and evaluate. It is hoped that in the process of learning what counts as good reasoning, one will become a better reasoner.",

The course will focus on key questions asked about the brain, such as: How is the brain organised? How do drugs affect our behaviour? How does the brain see, hear and produce movement? How does it learn and think? Clinical topics, such as Parkinson's Disease and schizophrenia will be integrated into the course, as will fMRI research methods and findings. Emphasis will be given to the key principles of nervous system function, however, the course still requires a lot of factual information to be assimilated and memorized.",

Two currently popular application areas are brain-machine/computer interfaces (using brain-waves to directly control robotic devices) and creating new &quot;sensory abilities&quot; in those people who have sensory impairments (e.g., the blind or deaf). The style of the course will be an informal one, and the &quot;lectures&quot; should be treated more like seminars/discussions.

It will also treat issues like ethnicity, religion, regime legitimacy and the relationship between violence and democracy. By studying these issues comparatively we can discern regular patterns in the behaviour of individuals and groups and understand how their demands are processed and met. The second part of the module will adopt a thematic approach to explain the various factors that have shaped intra-regional relations. This will include the role of external powers and also the spillover effect of domestic conflicts. Foreign policy objectives of the regional states and their threat perceptions will be the principal area of focus. The module will also deal with issues of regional order and stability.

This course examines the variety of social dimensions that shape human sexuality. A range of theoretical perspectives and cross-cultural comparisons are drawn in order to unravel the complexities of sexualities and to see how sexualities are shaped by historical norms, social scripts, political structures, global forces and commodification. Students are required to read historical materials, anthropological research and be familiar with political economy and social constructionist paradigms.",

We will also visit the development of techniques that probe the microscopic domain and use some of them (spectroscopy, tunnelling microscopy) in hands-on experiments. We will conclude by studying novel, cutting edge topics such as fullerenes and graphene.

			"description": "The history of Singapore has traditionally been conceived along internal lines, based mainly, if not solely, on the traditional trajectories of administrative, political and national historical narratives. Yet, as we all know, the evolution of Singapore, from classical regional emporium to international port city and strategic naval base, has all along been defined by much larger regional and international forces. After its emergence as a sovereign state in 1965, Singapore continues to project itself as a 'global city-state'. Our local society has an 'international' make-up, being the product as it were of historical and current diasporic trends. This module provides an international framework for a study of the history of Singapore, and seeks to examine the historical evolution of Singapore against the contexts of regional and international changes and developments from the 14th to the 20th century. This module is open to all students throughout NUS interested in Singapore history/studies.",

It also examines the fundamentals of urban design and the factors in the related fields of urban planning, architecture and landscape architecture that influence the creation of urban spaces. The course aims to lead students to critically examine and investigate the many ways through which the city is imagined, developed, formed and occupied. There are two components to the course, lectures and seminars. Lectures will present the theoretical concepts and models of thought regarding urban design. Seminars focus on the discussion and interrogation of influential writings and case studies of urban projects, and present opportunities for students to interpret and debate the relevance and applications of these modes of thinking and acting on the built environment.",

Yet, the theory of evolution is more controversial and opposed by more forces in society than any other theory in science. The module will revisit many of these objections and reveal that they are based on reasoning that is incompatible with the principles of science. We will investigate, why it is \"Neo-Darwinism\" and not \"Intelligent Design\" that is currently the best supported paradigm for explaining \"adaptation.\" We will then challenge the power of the neo-Darwinian paradigm by asking how seemingly incompatible phenomena like altruism and excessive male ornamentation can possibly be explained by natural selection. We will also study several key events in evolution such as the origin of sex and its numerous consequences and the origin of the human species. We will conclude with discussing the importance of the theory of evolution for understanding cultural evolution (\"memes\") and human health and senescence (\"Darwinian medicine\").",

Are they speculation or fact? How do we know? Of what use are they? How have they shaped our lives? In this module we will retrace the key ideas that led Einstein to his formulation of the Special Theory of Relativity, and how the concepts evolved through various personalities to produce the elegant spacetime version of the theory, culminating in the General Theory of Relativity. Along the way we will see the practical application of the scientific method and clarify common misconceptions of the theory. We will also study the impact Relativity has had on science, technology, philosophy and culture, and have a peek at the research frontier, where gravity and quantum theory meet, to be aware of open problems. Synopsis Einstein’s insight was that time must be relative, in contrast to Newton’s assumption of an absolute time. Time dilation (“moving clocks run slow”) is easily derived from Einstein’s postulates and it immediately implies a range of related effects such as the relativity of simultaneity and length contraction. These phenomena are seen to be interconnected through the formulation of a Minkowskian spacetime, which unites, and generalizes, Euclid’s space with Newton’s time. A further generalization leads to the General Theory of Relativity which shows gravity to be an effect of a dynamical curved spacetime, the framework for cosmology.",

Then we will practice creative thinking and explore strategies how to manage innovative teams. To show that creative strategic thinking plays a role in various domains of society we turn towards negotiation and deal-making.We conclude with ideas how to communicate new ideas best and a discussion on creative leadership.",

			"description": "This module requires students to reflect on and further develop the intellectual dimension of their academic, professional or social interests. It revolves around a series of talks given by invited speakers, organised into three strands: (i) the academic strand, which introduces various areas and modes of academic inquiry; (ii) the professional strand, which introduces various professions and looks into the nature of the knowledge society; (iii) the social strand, which examines an individual's intellectual and social engagement with the increasingly interdependent world. Facilitated by the instructors, students will engage in discussions in small groups. The focus of these discussions need not be on the content of the talks per se, but on the process of intellectual inquiry; and the aim is not to find answers per se, but to ask (good and feasible) questions. The module reinforces skills learnt in Writing and Critical Thinking, and allows students to apply them to a diverse range of issues. Assessed on a CS/CU basis, the 4-MC module is completed in two semesters (student's Semester 2 &amp; 3). Students are required to attend at least nine talks (minimum four per semester), participate actively in discussion, and submit four short response papers and two longer papers. Students will have to perform satisfactorily in each of these assessment modes. No partial MC will be given. Registration for this one-year long module will be opened for a new intake of first-year students only in Semester 2 of each academic year.",

Recent years have witnessed rapid urbanization in the developing Asia and transitional China and some of its consequences – substantial urban growth, dramatic ups and downs of real estate markets, financial markets as well as regional economies. The government officials and state-owned enterprise (SOE) executives are facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities, such as how urban planning theories may help to solve urban problems? How zoning regulation may affect urban land development? How bubbles in real estate market were formed? How do the fundamentals determine equilibrium demand, supply, and prices in the real estate market? How to make prudent real estate development decision?",

			"description": "The purpose of this seminar is to introduce students to the roles of randomness in scientific thinking. Some of the topics covered include the following: 1. Is probability intuitive? A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random rules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren’t easily done by other means? 6. Why is statistical thinking so crucial in modern scientific enquiries in which massive databases of mostly uninteresting information are being searched for interesting features (in astronomy, genetics and market research for example)?",

Very often misleading claims in science and in society more generally can arise from an ignorance of basic statistical ideas, but statistical methods can also be abused knowingly in fraudulent behaviour. On the other hand, statistical methods are also commonly used to detect and uncover fraud and dishonesty. After first looking at different kinds of deception involving data and the motivations for it this seminar will discuss the role of statistics in uncovering deception in areas such as: 1. Misleading claims in health; 2. Misleading surveys and opinion polls; 3. Claims and counterclaims in environmental science; 4. Fraud detection in the financial world; 5. Authorship disputes and detecting plagiarism It is intended that students gain an appreciation for basic statistical ideas for handling uncertainty as a key part of good scientific practice and decision making in society broadly.",

In the process, the course will also review the broad evolution of the international monetary system since the second half of the nineteenth century focusing on the nature of the international adjustment process under alternative exchange rate regimes, the Bretton Woods System of pegged but adjustable exchange rates, and the current period of generalized but differentiated floating (Bretton Woods II or Inflation Targeting Plus?). The course will also address a number of topical policy issues including the possible forms and rationales for the ongoing efforts to strengthen financial and monetary cooperation in Asia as well as the role the region is playing in financing global current account imbalances through massive reserve accumulation.

The famous GLOBE studies have clearly shown this to be true and how those differences impact leadership effectiveness not just between Asia and the rest of the world, but also within countries in Asia. Given the fact that many of our MBA graduates may end up working in Asia, it will be very useful for them to understand difference between Asia and the rest of the world, and differences between countries in Asia. This module aims to look at core concepts of leadership from a cross cultural perspective, with a heavy emphasis on leadership in Asia. We will examine the difference between leadership and management, the cultural context of leadership, personal attributes of the leader using the Big Five Personality Profiling, the many ways that leaders can exercise influence over his/her subordinates. We then examine the several major leadership models such as transformational leadership, servant leadership, authentic leadership, change leadership and see how a leadership practicitioner needs to adapt these approaches in order to be effective in different parts of Asia.",

Some of them include field study, survey and interview, questionnaire design and site inspections, which will be applicable to urban planning analyses. Students will appreciate the discourse on quantitative versus qualitative data and the central ideas in qualitative research - appropriateness of methods and theories; perspectives of the participants and their diversity; reflexivity of the researcher and the research; variety of approaches; and methods in qualitative research.

			"description": "Communication has long been taken as a core competency for undergraduate students in all major universities in the world and is a prerequisite skill almost invariably required by employers in today’s knowledgebased economy. Important communication skills for science undergraduates include the ability to critically read and comprehend science-related publications, and express and argue for their opinions in writing as well as in oral communication. This module aims to develop such ability of science undergraduates through reading, classroom discussion, summary writing, essay writing, and oral presentation activities.",

We then move to consider how ethics and leadership are intertwined, especially in work organizations. Organizations are “strong situations” which exert considerable influence on leaders’ perceptions, interpretations, judgements, decisions and behaviours. We consider how leaders can enhance ethical awareness, make decisions with ethics in mind, organize for ethical behaviour and face ethical challenges at the organizational level.",
