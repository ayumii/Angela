Models and analytical skills are introduced in order to solve business problems systematically.Information technology and the Internet have made many changes in the way businesses are run, and Managerial Economics has changed significantly with it. We now devote a new portion of this course to discussing how network effects propel the information age, resulting in significant monopoly powers such as Microsoft.

The teaching objective of the module is for faculty members with expertise in relevant fields of chemical research to impart knowledge on, provide guidance to and stimulate creative thinking of students with interest in modern chemistry. The students are expected to gain in-depth understanding of the chosen topic through discussions/meetings with the faculty members, his/her own research work, and preparation and presentation of written/oral reports. Each student is assigned at least one adviser from the faculty. The student should meet with his/her adviser at the beginning of the semester. The adviser and student will select a topic for investigation within the advisers area of expertise. For example, the assignment might require the students to read some recent journal articles or chapters in selected books. During subsequent meetings, the student and adviser will discuss the material and related issues. The student will then prepare a brief written report summarizing the background and significance of the problem under consideration, the approaches used to solve the problem, and the results of the investigations reported in the articles or books. The written report is due at the end of the semester. The student will also be required to make two oral presentations (one around the middle of the semester, and another one at the end of the semester) to show his or her understanding of the problem, and what he or she has read.",

			"title": "Chemical Kinetics & Reactor Design",
			"description": "The module begins with a quick revision of chemical kinetics in physical chemistry, emphasizing on the definitions of various reaction rates, rate expressions, and simple and complex reactions. The design equations for ideal reactors are then introduced followed by the general methods of analysis of rate data. Reactor sequencing, yield versus productivity in multiple reactions, and non-isothermal operations round up the first half of the course. More advanced topics such as coupling of reactions with transport processes, non-ideal flow behaviour in reactors, and reaction dynamics and stability, form the bulk of the second half of the course.",

These are followed by analyses for convective heat transfer and heat transfer with phase change, and subsequently radiative heat transfer. Heat exchangers and their design are discussed. Steady and unsteady-state molecular diffusion is studied, while convective mass transfer is analyzed using exact and approximate integral analysis. Finally, analogies between mass, heat and momentum transfer are discussed leading to the concept of transport phenomena.",

The rate-based design concept is then extended to operations involving simultaneous heat and mass transfer such as in cooling tower and dryer. The process design principles are illustrated with distillation, absorption, extraction, adsorption, cooling tower and drying processes.",

It emphasises, in contrast to other similar logic courses, on how logic can be used to represent computational problems, how these representations can be proven correct and how they can be executed on a computer. Topics covered include classical logic theories, logic programming, modal logic, and an introduction to non-standard logics. Treatments of predicate calculus and temporal logic are fully covered with emphasis on their specification, verification, deductive and algorithmic aspects.",

In the process of developing these tools, we will discuss the determinants of consumption and investment. Next we turn to different business cycle theories. Specifically, we study the Keynesian, New Keynesian, Neo Classical and Real Business Cycle models, and examine their different assumptions and policy prescriptions for macroeconomic stabilization. IS-LM and AD-AS frameworks are employed in studying some or all of these paradigms. Finally, we evaluate the predictions of these models against business cycle facts. We will also briefly review national income accounting and discuss some measurement issues.",

No prior background in statistics is needed as the course is intended to provide a rigorous statistical foundation for students who intend to study econometrics. The module begins with ways of summarizing economic data, including the use of frequency distributions and measures of central tendency and dispersion. This is followed by an initiation into the concepts of classical probability, paving the way for the important topics of random variables and probability distributions. Next, the core ideas of classical statistical inference are introduced - including sampling distributions, point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing and analysis of variance. Finally, correlation and regression analyses will be covered.",

It is designed to equip students with the standard tools and techniques to analyze microeconomic issues and to prepare them to access higher level modules that utilize microeconomic analysis. The module begins with a review of several foundation topics on consumer and producer theory covered in the prerequisite course, i.e. EC2101. It then moves on to discuss the general equilibrium model, whereby consumers and producers are put together in a general equilibrium framework. After that, it covers choice over time, i.e. inter-temporal choice and choices over different states of the world, i.e. choices under uncertainty. It then continues with game theory. This topic will be discussed extensively. Coverage will include various solution concepts for one-shot games and sequential move games. Applications of the theory on the issues of oligopolistic competition, entry and entry prevention, and network economics will receive a great deal of attention. Finally, the module ends with the asymmetric information, i.e. moral hazard and adverse selection and its application on the internal organisation of the firm. Throughout the course, empirical observations and real-life cases pertaining to the issues discussed in this module are presented.",

Aggregate Supply functions under differing assumptions regarding labour-market clearing and price expectations (rational or adaptive) are derived next, and combined with the Aggregate Demand function to study policy and other effects. We next examine the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve, and simple inflation-unemployment dynamics. We also study further policy issues (time inconsistency, Ricardian Equivalence, profit-sharing), open-economy macroeconomics (the Mundell-Fleming model), and simple growth theory (the Solow model and the AK endogenous growth model).",

In the first section, we discuss the solution of simple stochastic rational expectations models, and examine the main features of, and the key issues in the controversy between, the new classical, real business cycle, and Keynesian-New- Keynesian schools of thought. Topics covered include the Lucas, Sargent-Wallace and Fischer (overlapping wage contract) models, as well as the Shapiro-Stiglitz efficiency wage model and Romer's menu cost - coordination failure model. In the second section, various inter-temporal optimization models are analysed, and their salient economic lessons discussed. Topics covered include a two-period model, overlapping-generations models with certain and uncertain lifetimes, Hall's life-cycle-permanent-income model, as well as optimal control models of investment behaviour and endogenous growth. A lecture on some principal macroeconomic features of the Singapore Economy concludes the course.",

In applying theory to texts, we will identify and explore the plural and contradictory desires that make up literary discourse in particular, and the production of meaning, generally, just as our selections of literary works will help to exemplify key concepts in the psychoanalytic tradition.",

It explores the changing role of visual media across the centuries, from pre-modern societies through to today’s digital, networked cultures. How have technological and economic changes generated new visual media? How have these media in turn shaped social and economic life? A range of case studies will be drawn from art history, film, popular culture and online media. What are the differences between art, film and other visual culture, and are these differences still relevant in the ‘convergent’ world of digital media culture?",

In this course, you will examine concepts such as role and identity, speaker credibility, talk and gestures, and audience perception. You will explore the innateness and invention of specific speech traits and behaviours—with a focus on how a public persona is strengthened or attenuated, and shaped—by analyzing various performances (i.e., interview, roundtable discussion, public talk, and the US presidential debate 2012). The course assignments are expected to demonstrate your understanding of these human communication concepts and specific applications of your analysis outcomes in constructing a credible public persona in presentations.",

We will look at how images are arrayed with words in news sources to create a truth-effect. Unearthing the norms of objectivity that readers accept, we will ask how particular blogs and feeds become more credible than others. We will examine what happens to the truth-effect when images are digitized and manipulable. Lastly, we will analyze how they form persuasive arguments in documentaries that question the boundary between fact and faction, such as The Greatest Movie Ever Sold.",

			"description": "Can facts be assembled to reveal the truth of an event? Is it possible the truth of an event can be subjective? Looking at classic and current examples of non-fiction crime and disaster writing, we will explore the craft of writing on sensitive subjects with objectivity and clarity. Crime and disaster stories require detailed anecdotes and descriptions to hold the reader. But they often draw upon official documents that are sometimes bland statements of fact, eyewitness accounts that vary greatly, or the seemingly hidden world of text and social media. We will cast a critical eye over this process of building essays reports or memos with facts and interviews and discuss how some of the best writers in the business get it right, or not.",

Therefore, proper management of environmental resources by applying available and emerging environmental technologies in the planning, design and operation activities are important in global resource conservation and in environmental pollution control.",

Examples are plentiful, such as \"Molecular Biology\", \"Molecular Genetics\", \"Molecular Electronics\", \"Molecular Medicine\", \"Molecular Informatics\", \"Molecular Engineering\", \"Molecular Pharmacology\", \"Molecular Ecology\", \"Molecular Machines\"... etc. In the \"Science of Molecules\" viz. \"Chemistry\", the focus is on molecular design, molecular structure, molecular synthesis, molecular activity and molecular function. The function depends on the activity, which in turn is governed by the design and structure. Chemical synthesis is generally guided by good structural design. Molecular structures therefore are the fundamentals in molecular science. In this seminar series, we shall discuss with the class the underlying principles of chemical structures, with specific focus on the interrelationship among the five S's of molecules -Science, Structure, Stability, Symmetry, and, Space. The mode of teaching and learning focuses on group learning, interaction, independent enquiry, project work, molecular models, and public presentations. Writing and presentations are essential elements in this freshmen seminar. There will also be hands-on sessions on molecular models and molecular origami.

			"title": "FS: Randomness in Scientific Thinking",
			"description": "The purpose of this seminar is to introduce students to the roles of randomness in scientific thinking. Some of the topics covered include the following: 1. Is probability intuitive? A class exercise will be conducted where students are asked to generate sequences of real and fake random coin tosses and are asked to develop tests to detect the difference. 2. What is the role of randomization in the design of scientific experiments (for instance, why are patients randomly assigned to treatments in a medical trial)? We recreate a famous incident in which a tea time conversation led to a statistician conducting an experiment to test whether someone could distinguish whether milk had been added first or last to a cup of tea. 3. How has statistical thinking been used and abused in the history of IQ testing? 4. In the analysis of environmental problems like global warming scientific models are often used which are deterministic (roughly speaking, such models predict a definite output for a given input). A statistical model on the other hand gives predictions in the form of probabilities of different possible outcomes. How can the deep physical understanding embedded in the deterministic models be reconciled with statistical approaches to quantifying uncertainty and risk, and why is quantifying uncertainty important? 5. How can fake random numbers generated on a computer by non-random rules sometimes do complicated calculations that aren’t easily done by other means? 6. Why is statistical thinking so crucial in modern scientific enquiries in which massive databases of mostly uninteresting information are being searched for interesting features (in astronomy, genetics and market research for example)?",

			"title": "FS: Fraud, Deception and Data",
			"description": "The purpose of this seminar is to explore the relationship between fraud and deception and statistics. Very often misleading claims in science and in society more generally can arise from an ignorance of basic statistical ideas, but statistical methods can also be abused knowingly in fraudulent behaviour. On the other hand, statistical methods are also commonly used to detect and uncover fraud and dishonesty. After first looking at different kinds of deception involving data and the motivations for it this seminar will discuss the role of statistics in uncovering deception in areas such as: 1. Misleading claims in health; 2. Misleading surveys and opinion polls; 3. Claims and counterclaims in environmental science; 4. Fraud detection in the financial world; 5. Authorship disputes and detecting plagiarism It is intended that students gain an appreciation for basic statistical ideas for handling uncertainty as a key part of good scientific practice and decision making in society broadly.",

			"title": "FS: Analogy & Intuition in Mathematics",
			"description": "The development of mathematical concepts and theories is often influenced by an intuition acquired from physical experience and by analogy with various areas of scientific and mathematical knowledge. Analogy is an important factor in preparing, if not predicting, new concepts while an experience-based intuition can sometimes be an obstacle. The objective of this seminar module is to present case studies of the creative role of analogy in mathematics and of the ground-breaking importance of \"counter-intuition\" in modern mathematics. A wealth of examples of both can be found in geometry, number theory, analysis, algebra, logic, set theory and theoretical computer science. Students of this module are expected to source for relevant material in books, journals and the internet under the guidance of the lecturer. The emphasis, however, will be on the spirit of the mathematical enterprise rather than on the technical mastery. To illustrate the use of analogy and intuition in problem solving, some elementary problems and puzzles will be posed in class for attempt and discussion. The main prerequisite for this module is an inquiring mind open to new ideas.

			"title": "FS: Nanoworld and Synchrotron Radiation",
			"description": "The essence of nanoworld, i.e. nanoscience and technology, is the ability to understand and manipulate matter at the atomic level. Structures and electronic and magnetic structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced to the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre = 10-9 metre). They exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size. The nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and engineering. To understand the nanoworld, we will introduce basic and advance spectroscopy and scattering synchrotron-based techniques such as x-ray absorption, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, resonant soft x-ray scattering, xray photoemission spectroscopy, ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction. We will also introduce scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the main issues and techniques relevant to the nanometre scale. Questions that will be addressed include: What is the significance of the nanoscale? What measurement techniques allow us to examine such systems? How can we fabricate objects and devices on the nanometre scale? What are the examples of fascinating nanosystems? How will nanodevices and nanomaterials change our lives in the future? This module is targeted at students from different faculties who are interested in learning some general knowledge of nanoscience and nanotechnology.",

At such small length scales, nanoparticles often exhibit unusual properties that differ from their bulk counterparts. For example, a semiconductor nanoparticle of the same material can emit all colors of the rainbow as its size is varied from 1 to 7 nanometers in diameter while nanoparticles of gold no longer glitter but look red under room light. These properties are only beginning to be exploited for use in the medical, electronic and chemical industry and will undoubtedly have a great impact on next-generation technologies. Through this seminar module, students will be introduced to different nanoparticles and their physicochemical properties from a chemist’s perspective.

			"title": "Simple Chemistry for Different Disciplines",
			"description": "There are literally thousands of chemical reactions in the field of organic chemistry, but only a handful of them are most relevant to non-chemists (e.g. life scientists). The term bioorthogonal chemistry refers to some of these chemical reactions that can occur inside living systems without interfering with native biochemical processes. Since its introduction, the concept of the bioorthogonal reaction has enabled the study of many types of biomolecules under native cellular environments. In recent years, it has been expanded to many other fields, materials, nanotechnology and engineering. This seminar is intended for junior undergraduates who are interested in equipping themselves with a few very basic but essential set of organic reactions which are most relevant to non-specialists. The module will be conducted in the form of seminar discussion and presentations in a highly interactive manner. Both students and the professor will learn hand-in-hand about the subject of interest, and the students will be required to participate actively in twoway discussion. By using key examples in bioorthogonal chemistry developed in the last decade, the students will focus on interactive learning in unconventional ways (reading, literature search, group discussion, independent studies, presentation, etc). The professor will mostly serve as the facilitator (not feeder) of the learning process.",

The intermingling of people, the exchange of ideas and international commerce have been part of Southeast Asian life for centuries. This module surveys the broad currents of conflict, change and continuity across the region from a multidisciplinary perspective. It looks at how Southeast Asian societies and political systems have changed over time in response to the pressures of ecology, colonialism, nationalism, urbanization and globalization. The module also looks at the way ethnic, religious, national and regional identities have been constructed, used and altered over time. The overall objective is to provide students with an introduction to different ways of exploring Southeast Asia and different experiences of living in the region.",

			"description": "The essence of nanoscience and technology is the ability to understand and manipulate matter at the molecular level. Structures behave differently when their dimensions are reduced to the range of between one and a few hundred nanometres (1 nanometre = 10-9 metre). Such structures exhibit novel and much-improved mechanical, electrical, optical, chemical and biological properties, due entirely to their nanoscopic size. The nanoworld is therefore an exciting new realm that brings together the traditional disciplines of physics, chemistry, materials science, biology and engineering. The aim of this module is to familiarise students with the main issues and techniques relevant to the nanometre scale. Questions that will be addressed include: What is the significance of the nanoscale? What measurement techniques allow us to examine such systems? How can we fabricate objects and devices on the nanometre scale? What are the examples of fascinating nanosystems? How will nanodevices and nanomaterials change our lives in the future? This module is targeted at students from different faculties who are interested in learning some general knowledge of nanoscience and nanotechnology.",

No longer is human influence on the planet confined to the local environment, but now extends across political boundaries - often resulting in regional or even global impacts. As a result, society, industry and agriculture are under increasing pressure to improve environmental performance and cut resource consumption and pollution. Around the world, governments are striving to minimise waste production, protect water resources, reduce energy consumption and improve the quality of the urban living environment. As the human global population grows exponentially and the life-support systems of the planet continue to deteriorate, there is a growing international recognition that environmental problems require truly global solutions. This course will focus on the issues and causes of global environmental issues including: population growth, resource exploitation and threats to the atmosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere. The aim of the course will be to provide students with a knowledge and appreciation of the inter-related problems and challenges of sustainable development.",

This course will introduce students to: (1) Various phenomena/features related to the oceans, such as tsunamis, thermohalines, tides, currents, storms, marine life and bioluminescence etc.. (2) How the oceans affect our lives (e.g. weather, climate, sources of food, travel etc) , (3) Our attempts at understanding the workings of the oceans using exploration and the scientific theories that have been developed over the last few decades. (4) Our attempts at controlling and exploiting the oceans (e.g. conservation, energy, marine engineering). Students will gain an appreciation of the scientific principles involved with the minimum of mathematics. This course will also prepare studnets to better understand the role of oceans, and provide insight into making educated decisions regarding our vulnerable environment and our precious supply of water.",

The theoretical component will introduce the semiotic approach to accessing and analyzing both the dramatic and the performance texts, serving as a value-neutral system with which to evaluate classical and contemporary Asian and Western performance traditions. The theoretical component will also conduct a broad survey of the influential theories of theatre &amp; performance from the 20th century to the present, assessing their impact on contemporary global performance practices. Through the practical sessions, students will experience hands-on the various aspects of a stage production, from acting, directing to design and stage management.",

This module, requiring no background in biology or science history, will provide a solid background for understanding how the history of the theory of evolution actually unfolded. The course covers the history of geology, paleaontology and biology from the 1700s to the 20th century. The central focus is on the life and work of Charles Darwin (1809-1882) and how biological evolution was uncovered and accepted by the international scientific community in the 19th century, and beyond. There are case studies on how to assess historical claims and evidence. The final 3 or 4 lectures discuss recent developments in evolutionary biology.",

Evaluation is based on 100% Continuous Assessment and must be worked out between the student and the supervisor prior to seeking the College’s approval.

Specific case studies are drawn on to allow a closer understanding of the way Chinese businesses were established and how they developed. The social, economic and cultural aspects closely associated with the Chinese business community of Singapore, such as early Chinese migration, dialect organisations, guilds, occupational structure, Chinese merchant culture, as well as the transformation and globalisation of Chinese businesses will also be discussed.

			"title": "Process Analysis and Redesign",
			"description": "Process Analysis and Redesign is a systematic approach to helping an organization analyze and improve its processes. In this course the term ‘redesign’ includes ‘reengineering’. All systems are designed and developed to support business processes. Therefore, an understanding of the business processes is crucial to choosing how to build and manage systems, re-skill personnel and retool the infrastructure. A business process is a collection of activities that creates an output that is of value to some customer. Business processes can be improved at any level of an organization or can be improved across multiple organizations. Typically, Business Process Redesign/Reengineering (BPR) uses information technology to enable business process change in order to reduce costs, improve service, and reduce cycle times. Several BPR methodologies exist. Most methodologies require the construction of an “As-Is” and “To-Be” model. This course will discuss the role of BPR in managing technology and the operational functions. The course will cover the strategic, operational and technological dimensions of BPR in the context of quality improvement, Information Technology and business operations. Case studies will provide real-world context for the concepts discussed in class. The course is designed to teach students BPR methodologies and modeling techniques that accompany the methodology. Students will identify an organization (or part of an organization) that needs improvement. Next, they will analyze the current system, investigate possible Information Technology and operational solutions, redesign the current system and propose a plan to move from the “As-Is” system to the “To-Be” system.",

Meanwhile, Asian cinemas are on the rise, offering local moviegoers alternatives to the Hollywood blockbusters that have dominated theaters across the globe for decades. Hollywood has become an export-driven industry, and Asia provides its most important overseas market. In this small seminar, students will discuss topics such as the most recent kung fu movie craze, Hollywood remakes of Asian films, and cross-cultural fandom. We'll analyze films such as Infernal Affairs, Slumdog Millionaire, and Rush Hour 2. Studying both popular media coverage and academic essays, students will learn how authors construct arguments around a particular topic, how these discourses respond to one another, and how they themselves can construct their own responses to a topic.",

The course will leverage on the experience gained through establishing Singapore as a “Garden City”. The creation of a forest within a city, an &quot;urban forest”, is one of its aims. The course will start with an appreciation of the immense biodiversity of plants in our region. The irreplaceable values that natural primary forests have will be emphasized. The case of the need to extend these forests by recreating them in the urban context will be discussed. The appropriate use of non-indigenous plants will also be covered. The need to be ecological-minded when selecting plants will be emphasized with particular attention being placed on conservation; the beautification of place should not be done at the expense of making another landscape look less attractive. Lectures will be augmented with field trips which serve illustrate the application of the principles discussed to the ground. The business implications to matching the right plant to site, using quality plants and then being able to care for them professionally will be covered.",

Since neurons and muscle tissues require a relatively constant extracellular environment for them to function properly, the important concept of homeostasis will be discussed. Emphasis will be on extracellular fluid volume and composition. In addition, mechanisms involved in the balance of heat gain and heat loss to maintain a constant body temperature will be covered.",

We formulate linear programming (LP) problems and solve them by the simplex method (algorithm). We also look at the geometrical aspect and develop the mathematical theory of the simplex method. We further study problems which may be formulated using graphs and networks. These optimization problems can be solved by using linear or integer programming approaches. However, due to its graphical structure, it is easier to handle these problems by using network algorithmic approaches. Applications of LP and network optimization will be demonstrated. This course should help the student in developing confidence in solving many similar problems in daily life that require much computing. Major topics: Introduction to LP: solving 2-variable LP via graphical methods. Geometry of LP: polyhedron, extreme points, existence of optimal solution at extreme point. Development of simplex method: basic solution, reduced costs and optimality condition, iterative steps in a simplex method, 2-phase method and Big-M method. Duality: dual LP, duality theory, dual simplex method. Sensitivity Analysis. Network optimization problems: minimal spanning tree problems, shortest path problems, maximal flow problems, minimum cost flow problems, salesman problems and postman problems.",

Topics that are also introduced are actuators for achieving motion, primarily various types of electric motors. This course also covers the generalised measurement and instrumentation system, the associated electronics, drivers and power supplies for the processing of the signals from the sensors and transducers and for driving the various actuators. Emphasis is placed on the knowledge required for the application of these sensors and actuators rather than on their design.",

This course will lead the students from the basic fundamentals of acoustics through various noise-producing mechanismsand finally control measures that can be applied to different circumstances.

			"title": "Marketing Research",
			"description": "Effective marketing research is necessary for successful management of all phases of the marketing process, ranging from product development and introduction to selling through growth and maturity stages. In today's information-oriented environment, a marketing manager cannot succeed without a thorough understanding of the research process. By understanding the research process, he can better judge the suitability, reliability and the validity of a research study in his decision-makings. Students will learn by doing in this course. While we will use class time to discuss appropriate research topics, students are required to do lots of activities by themselves in order to facilitate their learning by doing. In doing so, this course incorporates an experimental element in marketing research and consulting. As a marketing information provider, students will be assisting a firm by collecting and interpreting market data as a means toward the development of a superior marketing plan. At the same time, students will conduct tutorial activities that will provide opportunities for students to practice the key topics covered in the class. This course is intended to acquaint students with the fundamental marketing research process. More specifically, this course aims: (i) To familiarise the student with the fundamental marketing research skills of problem formulation, research design, questionnaire design, data collection, data analysis, and report presentation and writing. (ii) To have the student gain perspective and practice in applying these skills through a research project. (iii) To develop an understanding of decision making in marketing, its inherent difficulties and pitfalls and the importance of information in marketing research.",

Throughout the course an attempt will be made to understand the way students think, the biases they hold when making decisions and interpreting environmental stimuli in the context of organisations, and the ways in which their emotions influence their decisions and judgments.

From repurposing games, toys, and radios to building oscillators, filters, mixers, and amplifiers, and finally interfacing between the physical world and computers via microcontrollers, students will explore the artistic potential of electronic circuits. An introduction to the history and current practice of electronic sound art will be integral to the module. The module will culminate in a group installation/performance. No prior experience in electronics or music is assumed, though either would be helpful.",

It covers basic concepts in research design, instrumentation, data collection, and data analysis. Related topics on validity, reliability, and ethical issues in conducting research are also covered. While the main focus remains on the research methods, this module also introduces basic concepts of statistics such as descriptive statistics, sampling distribution, hypothesis testing. Basic levels of parametric and non parametric statistics are also introduced. A set of computer lab assignments will give students extensive opportunity to become familiar with the SPSS computer software package and experience at computing the various statistics reviewed in the class.",

			"description": "This module introduces fundamental concepts of physics and is illustrated with many practical examples. Topics covered include a) Electricity and magnetism, where the basic concepts of electric and magnetic fields, forces on charged particles, electric potential, electromotive force, work and energy, are described. The properties of basic electrical circuits comprising resistors, inductors and capacitors are discussed, along with analysis of their transient and steady-state behaviour. Understanding the role of Maxwell's equations in electromagnetism is emphasized; b) Waves, introducing properties of waves, including geometric optics, propagation, interference and diffraction, and electromagnetic waves; and c) Quantum physics, where new physics concepts which led to the quantization of energy are introduced, leading to an explanation of atomic transitions, atomic spectra and the physical and the chemical properties of the atom. The uncertainty principle, wave-mechanics and wave particle duality concepts are covered, together with the use of wavefunctions in predicting the behaviour of trapped particles. The module is targeted essentially at Engineering students.",

After a discussion of the various versions of Bernoulli's equation and the concept of vorticity, the study of fluid flows starts with the potential flows, with an application to the theory of airfoils. The theory of irrotational water waves is then presented to illustrate dispersive wave propagation and the hyperbolic tendency to form shocks. The balance of these two tendencies produces soliton solutions. The concept of flow similarity is applied to the study of boundary layer. The phenomenon of boundary layer separation is discussed. The concept of hydrodynamic instability is illustrated with the Rayleigh-Benard convection problem. The chaotic dynamics of the related Lorenz equation is then presented.

Successive lectures investigate alternative conceptions of the human condition, such as ones in which we are unfree, or non-spirituous, or inhabit a world whose fundamental nature is hidden from our view. Different conceptions bear differently on the further question of what we should value and why. Discussion is both argument-driven and historically informed.",

Although no background knowledge is assumed other than from the introductory psychology course, those with an interest in biological bases of behaviour or neuroscience will be advantaged. The course is intended primarily for students doing a single major in Psychology, and is designed as an introduction to those wishing to pursue advanced courses in Cognitive Neuroscience (PL3285 &amp; PL4206). The course will focus on key questions asked about the brain, such as: How is the brain organised? How do drugs affect our behaviour? How does the brain see, hear and produce movement? How does it learn and think? Clinical topics, such as Parkinson's Disease and schizophrenia will be integrated into the course, as will fMRI research methods and findings. Emphasis will be given to the key principles of nervous system function, however, the course still requires a lot of factual information to be assimilated and memorized.",

The idea that behaviour, like physical structure, is evolved in response to selection pressures carries implications for understanding phenomena in a range of diverse fields such as logical reasoning, altruism, competition, mate selection, aggressive behaviour, attachment and child maltreatment. Pitfalls and limitations in the speculative use of evolutionary explanations will be considered, and the way in which such explanations complement those couched in terms of psychological processes or mechanisms will be explored.",

Masters and Ph.D. students who specialise in international relations will be required to read this module. The module will introduce to students important and influential theories on international relations, including realism and liberalism, that attempt to explain cooperation and conflict among nations. Students will also be exposed to some of the important methods of analysis - such as case studies, formal modeling, and statistical analysis - that help distinguish the current study of international relations from that of previous eras. Important approaches, such as constructivism and rational choice, will also be discussed. Under the instructor's guidance, students will undertake an academic-quality presentation to the class and write a paper which proposes in detail an original research project in international relations",

In particular, the manufacturing industries in some countries have remained backward and depended heavily on the use of labour while in other countries, they have become more advanced and relied more on the use of capital. This module discusses the theory and concepts that relate to industrialisation. It also investigates the industrial experiences of other countries and the lessons from them. Focus will be on Singapore, and how it compares with other SE Asian countries.",

Especially several South-Indian dynasties (as, e.g. the Pallavas and the Cholas), under which trade and the setting up of diplomatic ties flourished, were the main responsible forces for an early spread of Indian cultural and social concepts and values beyond South Asia – and especially to Southeast Asia. The module aims at looking at those early forms of contact between the two regions, and at providing an understanding of the concepts of “kingship”, society, religion and culture, that became shared as a consequence. We will explore how much about “everyday life” in old times can be learned from inscriptions, and how temple-constructions and other pieces of Art can give insights into these concepts. We will also look into early trade-connections between South India and Southeast Asia (trading guilds) and into the impact of cultural influence – especially of the Chola dynasty – in the region.",

It traces the evolution of the Chinese business community and examines the growth and expansion of their networks in East and Southeast Asia. It also examines the roles played by colonial authorities and the 'China connection' in the development of these business networks. Specific case studies are drawn on to allow a closer understanding of the way Chinese businesses were established and how they developed. The social, economic and cultural aspects closely associated with the Chinese business community of Singapore, such as early Chinese migration, dialect organisations, guilds, occupational structure, Chinese merchant culture, as well as the transformation and globalisation of Chinese businesses will also be discussed.

			"title": "The Evolution of a Global City-State",
			"description": "The history of Singapore has traditionally been conceived along internal lines, based mainly, if not solely, on the traditional trajectories of administrative, political and national historical narratives. Yet, as we all know, the evolution of Singapore, from classical regional emporium to international port city and strategic naval base, has all along been defined by much larger regional and international forces. After its emergence as a sovereign state in 1965, Singapore continues to project itself as a 'global city-state'. Our local society has an 'international' make-up, being the product as it were of historical and current diasporic trends. This module provides an international framework for a study of the history of Singapore, and seeks to examine the historical evolution of Singapore against the contexts of regional and international changes and developments from the 14th to the 20th century. This module is open to all students throughout NUS interested in Singapore history/studies.",

			"description": "The Capstone Experience is open to undergraduate members of the College (Year 2 and above) and builds on the first and second year modules of the UTown Residential Programme. Students may elect to work individually (e.g. as part of an internship) or in an multidisciplinary group. Together with an external organization, and under the guidance of an academic supervisor, they apply disciplinary knowledge and skills to address an issue or question which is authentic and of practical relevance to the community. In the process, students engage communities and organizations either locally or abroad in planning, implementing and communicating their ideas and concepts, develop collaborative and leadership skills, cultural competency and an awareness of civic values. The learning experience is reflected in well-researched and thoughtful situational analyses, a learning journal, and midterm and final reports or presentations. Capstone experiences will be supervised by College faculty with expertise in the chosen area, with the participation of a qualified preceptor from the external organization.",

Teaching and assessment modes include lectures, seminars, workshops and guided practical coursework.",

The module will revisit many of these objections and reveal that they are based on reasoning that is incompatible with the principles of science. We will investigate, why it is \"Neo-Darwinism\" and not \"Intelligent Design\" that is currently the best supported paradigm for explaining \"adaptation.\" We will then challenge the power of the neo-Darwinian paradigm by asking how seemingly incompatible phenomena like altruism and excessive male ornamentation can possibly be explained by natural selection. We will also study several key events in evolution such as the origin of sex and its numerous consequences and the origin of the human species. We will conclude with discussing the importance of the theory of evolution for understanding cultural evolution (\"memes\") and human health and senescence (\"Darwinian medicine\").",

This course will introduce you to the recently developed field of biosemiotics the interdisciplinary study of sign processes as they occur variously across the biological spectrum. Looking at the close relation between living systems and their sign systems (hence the term: bio-semiotics), this still-emerging discipline seeks to traces the evolutionary development of sign-mediated ways of being in the world from its beginnings in the transmission of information across single cells to its most complicated realisation in the abstract forms of human thought.",

It is often directed with negative effect towards figures and structures of authority, and is sometimes an integral part of a world-view. Students will engage closely with a variety of texts of different types, including poems, tracts, short stories, speeches, plays, sketches, songs and pictures. In doing so, they will reach a better understanding of the roles irony can play not only in literature, but also in society more generally. Since the texts are drawn from different historical times, media and geographical locations, students will get a sense of the widespread use of irony in culture and society.",

Facilitated by the instructors, students will engage in discussions in small groups. The focus of these discussions need not be on the content of the talks per se, but on the process of intellectual inquiry; and the aim is not to find answers per se, but to ask (good and feasible) questions.

			"title": "Writing & Critical Thinking: Power, Space and Pleasure",
			"description": "This module examines the ways power, space, and pleasure are interconnected. The module is divided into three units. First, we will look at how space is related to questions of power, focusing in particular on surveillance. Then, in the second unit, we will consider more closely the relation between space, power and pleasure as exemplified in voyeurism and surveillance : here we will be watching people watching other people. Finally, we'll consider the relations between space, power and pleasure in Singapore, in particular as this applies to the tensions between traditional practices and urban planning in city spaces here.",

			"title": "Writing & Critical Thinking: Sites of Tourism",
			"description": "This module like others in the Writing and Critical Thinking area helps students become better writers of argumentative essays. To do this, we will specifically examine the modern phenomenon that is tourism, asking questions such as: What is a tourist? Why do we become tourists? Why do we send postcards, take photographs, or collect souvenirs? Do tourists find ourselves when we go abroad? Do we lose ourselves? How are cultures packaged for tourists, and is this packaging always reductive? Such questions will help us to understand the assumptions behind tourism, and to explore issues of modernity, nationality, self and other, identity and culture.",

			"title": "Writing & Critical Thinking: Technologies of Home",
			"description": "Domestic life is routinely held up for admiration as pure or natural. But how many of us experience family time/space in that way? Challenging the truism that domesticity offers a refuge from the modern world, this module recognises that technology makes it possible for modern people to be, and feel, at home. Some relevant technologies involve engines or electronics. But others organise ideas about gender, room, place and belonging. By enhancing awareness of domesticity’s “constructed nature,” this module deepens understanding of home sweet home.",
